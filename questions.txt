For Thurdsday meeting

Settled on end line coding for files.  Is it necessary since I found a way to set up a dialect
of csv reader, writer to use pipes | rather than csv?

Putting sql table definitions into their own files rather than coding them - thoughts

Table definitions started and noted in a file.

How many database to have?  Thought is one for songbooks (Print and Search), Suggestions and
     a third one for Songs Used.  Easier to keep organized and recover if multiple rather than 
     one.
