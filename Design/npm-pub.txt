Note: Even as this list is being compiled, in addition to the annual editions of worship aids such as the Music Issue, Breaking Bread, and Word and Song, there are two or more editions circulating of several major resources: Gather Comprehensive (1994 and 2005), We Celebrate (current edition 2011), Flor y Canto (1989 and 2001), Journeysongs (1994 and 2003), and Glory and Praise Comprehensive Edition (1987) and Glory and Praise second edition (1997). We have tried to reference the most recent edition of these resources in each year of the three-year cycle, but there may be some overlap with prior editions. So if you do not find a particular reference in one edition, check the index: It may be listed at another number or it may be in another edition of the resource you are using.
