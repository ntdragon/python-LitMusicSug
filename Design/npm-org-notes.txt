'THIRTIETH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME C Lectionary #150 
The Lord hears the cry of the poor: This truth should give us cause to reflect on our own care for the poor, because the message today is not necessarily good news for those who are well off.

Sirach 35:12-14, 16-18. “The Lord is a God of justice.” What does justice look like today? Especially in relationship to the poor, the oppressed, and the abandoned?

Psalm of the Day: Ps (33) 34. This is the song of an individual giving thanks that God has heard the person’s prayer.
