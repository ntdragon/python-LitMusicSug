# Liturgical Music Suggestions Program

## Introduction

This program is designed to be an assist to Roman Catholic Music Directors and musicians who 
are tasked with setting up music to be used at Mass on Sundays and Holy Days.  The program
will get input from its own database plus allow for suggestions from NPM and other sources
to be added.

## Initial Setup files

This program comes with a few files that were used in the design, development and testing of 
the program but you may need to create and set up some text files for for your parish.

The initial files needed to set up the programs database are;
* Songbook file - a file containing the song numbers song titles and are they a Psalm or Song.
     A Psalm indicates a song that may be used instead of the scriptural passage. Provided
     with the program should be GatherPrint.txt and Gather3Print.text which are for Gather
     Comprehensive and Gather Comprehensive Third Edition respectively.
* Search file - a file containing song titles or first lines of songs and which song numbers
     they are for for a particular book.  GatherSearch.txt and Gather3Search.txt should be
     part of this install package.
* Event file - a file containing lines having liturgical year, liturgical event and song title
     suggested for that event.  SongSuggestions.txt and PsalmSuggestions.txt are provided to
     get you started.
